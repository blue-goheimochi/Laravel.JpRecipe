{problem}
You need additional help.

You ran into a problem trying to do something in Laravel and cannot find the answer in any of the documentation sources.
{/problem}

{solution}
Ask the Laravel Community for help.

Join the **#laravel** channel using IRC. If you don't have an IRC client, try the [Laravel Web IRC Client](http://laravel.io/irc).

You also can post your question on the [Laravel Forums](http://forums.laravel.io).

{discussion}
The quickest way to receive help is through IRC.

There are always dozens of people logged in, eager to help. Often you'll be asked to show a snippet of the code you're having troubles with. Try paring down your code to the minimum representation of the problem and paste it at [paste.laravel.com](http://paste.laravel.com/). This provides a quick way to share your code so others can help.

{solution}
Here's the list.

* `php artisan auth:reminders` - [[Creating a Migration for Password Reminders]]
* `php artisan auth:clear-reminders` - [[Clearing Expired Password Reminders]]
* `php artisan auth:reminders-controller` - [[Creating a Reminders Controller]]

Of course, you could also just type `php artisan` and read through the list of commands.

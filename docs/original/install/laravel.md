You do not install Laravel.

Unlike [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) or [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/), you do not download and install Laravel.

Instead, you create a new project and specify Laravel as one of the project's dependencies. This allows Composer to download and install the version of Laravel you want to use as part of your project.

Laravel makes this process easy to accomplish with a single command. See [[Creating a Laravel Project]] for details on creating a new Laravel project.
